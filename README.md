<img src="" alt="banner that says Adam Piskorek - software tester, blogger and community organizer">

I'm a Software Tester who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, VueJS and Django. I recently started studying Cybersecurity Master and I'm striving to become pentester.  My interest in the Django ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://tobeprint3d.com/">GitHub Star ðŸŒŸ</a>, a 3D printing community for people who print.
